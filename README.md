Although Tempo's can be used entirely without physical access control, the use of such control allows for an experience as possible:

* Only the person who booked can access the room: no more abuse.
* If a reservation is over but nobody comes to the room, the system notifies you. You detect abuses and oversights and usually difficult to spot.
* The system can be linked to your lighting and heating to make significant energy savings.
